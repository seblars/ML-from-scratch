# ML-from-scratch
During my time as a tutor in ME4 Machine Learning course, I found it usful to implement algorithms from scratch to improve my own understanding of the underlying maths. This repository is my attempt to codify that learning into a concise format. I put forward the maths for each algorithm. As a sanity check I then compare results with sklearn.
