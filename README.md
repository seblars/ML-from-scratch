# ML-from-scratch
As a teaching assistant for a Machine Learning course, I found it usful to implement many of the algorithms from scratch. I have added notes on the derivation of each algorithm. I also compare the outputs with a library implementation such as sci-kit learn or PyTorch.

Algorithms covered in tutorials:
- Naive Bayes :heavy_check_mark:
- Linear Regression :heavy_check_mark:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM) (in-progress)
- Fully Connected Neural Networks :heavy_check_mark:
- K Nearest Neighbors (KNN) :heavy_check_mark:
- Decision Trees :heavy_check_mark:
- K-Means clustering :heavy_check_mark:
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA):heavy_check_mark:

Additional implementations:
- Logistic Regression :heavy_check_mark:
- Mixture of Gaussians :heavy_check_mark:
