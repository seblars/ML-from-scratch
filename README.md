# ML-from-scratch
As a teaching assistant for a Machine Learning course, I found it usful to implement many of the algorithms from scratch. I have added notes on the derivation of each algorithm. I also compare the performance with a library implementation such as scikit-learn or PyTorch.

Algorithms covered in tutorials:
- Naive Bayes :heavy_check_mark:
- Linear regression :heavy_check_mark:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Fully Connected Neural Networks
- K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- KMeans Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis

Additional implementations:
- Logistic Regression :heavy_check_mark:
- Convolutional Neural Networks
