# ML-from-scratch
As a teaching assistant for a Machine Learning course, I found it usful to implement many of the algorithms from scratch. I have added notes on the derivation of each algorithm. I also compare the performance with a library implementation such as scikit-learn or PyTorch.

Algorithms covered in tutorials:
- Naive Bayes :heavy_check_mark:
- Linear Regression :heavy_check_mark:
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Fully Connected Neural Networks
- K Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- KMeans Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis

Additional implementations:
- Logistic Regression :heavy_check_mark:
- Convolutional Neural Networks


Testing maths:

h<sub>&theta;</sub>(x) = &theta;<sub>o</sub> x + &theta;<sub>1</sub>x

$\sum_{i=0}^n i^2 = \frac{(n^2+n)(2n+1)}{6}$

![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\Large&space;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}) 

![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%3D%5Cfrac%7B-b%5Cpm%5Csqrt%7Bb%5E2-4ac%7D%7D%7B2a%7D)

```math
a^2+b^2=c^2
```

This math is inline $`a^2+b^2=c^2`$.
