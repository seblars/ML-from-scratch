# ML-from-scratch
During my time as a teaching assistant for a Machine Learning course, I found it usful to implement many of the algorithms and neural networks from scratch. Keeping them here for future reference.

Algorithms covered in the course:
- Naive Bayes U+2705
- Linear regression
- Linear discriminant analysis
- Fully connected neural networks
- Random forrest
- Linear SVM

Additional implementations:
- Logistic regression
